#   ./run_script_remotely.sh [path_to_hostfile] [remote_script]

# Example:
#   ./run_script_remotely.sh hosts.txt my_script.sh
#
# Description:
#   Reads each hostname from the specified file, then SSH into each host
#   and run the remote script in the background on the remote machine using nohup.

# Exit immediately if any command fails:
